Overview
========

Current `OXID eShop <http://www.oxid-esales.com/en/home.html>`_ development
environment is inspired by `PuPHPet <https://puphpet.com/>`_ and
`Phansible <http://phansible.com/>`_ projects.

Virtual environment is built using:

* `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ - virtual environment automation tool;
* `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`_ - environment orchestration tool;
* `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ - solution configuration.

Final solution is composed of two repositories (*linked using git sub-modules*):

* `Base VM <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_base>`_ - Base LAMP stack
  (*also used as base for other VMs*);
* `eShop VM <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop>`_ - Current repository,
  eShop specific configuration, roles and
  `SDK components <http://wiki.oxidforge.org/SDK>`_.

Getting started
===============

Before proceeding with `Quick start`_ please ensure that the
`Dependencies`_ listed below are installed.

.. _`Dependencies`

Dependencies
------------

* `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`_ (>=1.8.6)
* `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ [#virtualbox_dependency]_ (>=4.2, except 5.1.8, see `#29 <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop/issues/29>`_; Windows users see `#32 <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop/issues/32>`__)
* `Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_
* `OpenSSH <http://www.openssh.com/>`_ (*Only client part is needed*)
* Vagrant plugins:

  * ``vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager vagrant-triggers``
  * ``vagrant plugin install vagrant-lxc`` (*If* `LXC <https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc>`_ *will be used for provision process.*)
  * ``vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels`` (*If* `Parallels <https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels>`_ *will be used for provision process.*)

.. _`Quick start`

Quick start
-----------

**Note for Windows users**: Use console with **Administrator privileges** to run vagrant commands! 

* Clone [#recursive_clone]_ out current repository:

.. code:: bash

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop.git

* Start the VM:

.. code:: bash

  cd oxvm_eshop
  vagrant up

* After successful provision process use the following links to:

  * Open OXID eShop: http://www.oxideshop.dev/
  * Access admin area: http://www.oxideshop.dev/admin/

    * Username: ``admin``
    * Password: ``admin``

* If something doesn't work, see the `Troubleshooting`_ section.

.. [#virtualbox_dependency] VirtualBox is listed as dependency due to the fact
  that it is the default chosen provider for the VM. In case other providers
  will be used there is no need to install VirtualBox. Please refer to the list
  of possible providers in the configuration section to get more information.
.. [#recursive_clone] Since the current eShop VM repository is linked through git sub-modules
  it is mandatory to use ``--recursive`` option to instruct ``git`` and clone
  base VM repository as well.

Configuration
=============

Default virtual environment configuration should be sufficient enough to get
the eShop CE/PE/EE versions up and running. However, it is possible to adjust
the configuration of virtual environment to better match personal preferences.

All configuration changes should be done by overriding variables from:

* `default.yml <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_base/blob/master/ansible/vars/default.yml>`_ - base vm variables;
* `oxideshop.yml <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop/blob/master/ansible/vars/oxideshop.yml>`_ - eShop specific variables.

These overridden values must be placed in ``personal.yml``
[#personal_git_ignore]_ file at the root level of current repository.
_
For the overridden values to take effect please run ``vagrant provision``. If
the changes are related to the shared folder use ``vagrant reload``. In case the
provision process will start to show any kind of errors, please try to use
``vagrant destroy && vagrant up`` for the process to stat over from a clean
state.

To double check the merged version of configuration just run ``vagrant config``.

Hint: you have to care for the syntax/semantics at yourself. So, if you get an error while ``vagrant provision``
your personal.yml is the start point for troubleshooting. Has every entry value? At the moment no empty entries will work.

Examples
--------

Below is a list of possible frequent changes which are typically done after
cloning this repository.

One can just copy and paste the example snippets from the list below to the
``personal.yml`` file at the root of this repository.

Use older eShop version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current VM configuration is optimized to work with latest version of OXID eShop: ``v6.0-beta``.
In order to use VM with an older OXID eShop version please make the following adjustments to the configuration
file:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  eshop:
    composer:
      vendor: "{{ eshop_path.source }}/vendor"

Don't forget to follow the installation instructions which are provided with the eShop,
e.g. version ``5.3`` requires some `additional steps <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxideshop_ce/tree/b-5.3-ce#installation>`_ before the provision process. These steps might include (but is not limited to) addition of flow theme and demodata files.

Use NFS for shared-folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If `LXC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC>`_ is not available on your host system the best (so far) method to
share your application folder would be to use `NFS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System>`_.

In order to trigger NFS usage inside the VM one has to add the following configuration:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  vagrant_local:
    vm:
      app_shared_folder:
        sync_type: nfs

Beware that in order for this to work your host system must support NFS server:

* OS X/macOS has this integrated out-of-the-box
* Various GNU/Linux distributions might require additional setup:

  * `Ubuntu <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-16-04>`_
  * `Debian <https://wiki.debian.org/NFSServerSetup>`_
  * `RHEL/CentOS <https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/setting-up-an-nfs-server-and-client-on-centos-7/>`_
  * `ArchLinux <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS>`_

Be aware that NFS also has it's own limitations:

* No server is available for Microsoft Windows
* NFS uses network stack to share data
* NFS does not propagate file change events to the guest system
* Sometimes NFS is complicated to setup/troubleshoot in a non-standard environment

Change PHP version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default 5.6 PHP version found in given PPA repository is installed.

In order to switch to different PHP version one must update configuration as following:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  php:
    version: 7.1

Available choices: ``5.6``, ``7.0`` and ``7.1``


Change MySQL version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MySQL versioning is not yet automated via Ansible, in order to change the
version of MySQL service, please apply the following commands after calling
``vagrant ssh``:

.. code:: bash

  wget http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.7-1_all.deb
  sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.7-1_all.deb
  # Choose MySQL version to install
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Change VM provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change VM provider from VirtualBox (*default*) to LXC.
A list of available and tested providers [#list_of_providers]_:

- `virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ - Default provider which is free
  to use and available on all major operating systems;
- `lxc <https://linuxcontainers.org/>`_ [#lxc_provider]_ - Operating system
  level virtualization which vastly improves I/O performance compared to
  para-virtualization solutions;
- `parallels <http://www.parallels.com/eu/>`_ [#parallels_provider]_ - Commercial
  VM provider for OS X.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  vagrant_local:
    vm:
      provider: lxc

Set eShop to UTF-8 mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default shop will be installed with UTF-8 mode disabled (*with*
``iUtfMode = '0'`` *value inside* ``config.inc.php``).

In order to turn on the UTF-8 mode:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  eshop:
    config:
      utf_mode: 1

This change will not affect the already configured shop [#turn_on_utf_mode]_ .

Use SSL
^^^^^^^

By default the shop is served using regular HTTP protocol. In order to use
SSL use the following configuration snippet:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  eshop:
    config:
      use_ssl: 1

This configuration will automatically update ``config.inc.php`` file to contain
necessary changes for using SSL.

Change shared folder path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the default application shared folder from ``oxideshop`` to local path
``/var/www`` and update eShop target folder [#eshop_target]_.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  vagrant_local:
    vm:
      app_shared_folder:
        source: /var/www
        target: /var/www
  eshop_target_path: /var/www/oxideshop

Define github token for composer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provide OAuth token from github for composer so that the access API limit could
be removed [#github_token]_.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  php:
    composer:
      github_token: example_secret_token

Change ubuntu repository mirror url
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the default ubuntu repository mirror url from ``http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/``
to ``http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/``.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  server:
    apt_mirror: http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

Change virtual host
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the default virtual host from ``www.oxideshop.dev`` to
``www.myproject.dev``.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  vagrant_local:
    vm:
      aliases:
        - www.myproject.dev

Change the display mode of errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default the `display_errors` option is turned on. To change
the behavior you can use:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  php:
    display_errors: Off

Change MySQL password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the default MySQL user password from ``oxid`` to ``secret``.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  mysql:
    password: secret

Trigger Varnish installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trigger `Varnish <https://www.varnish-cache.org/>`_ installation so that it can
be used within OXID eShop.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  varnish:
    install: true

The above change will only trigger installation of Varnish with it's distributed
default configuration (``default.vcl``) which is not compatible with OXID eShop.

In order to make Varnish compatible with OXID eShop the following items must
be done:

* Download ``oxid-esales/varnish-configuration`` composer package;
* Copy the ``VCL`` files into the system where Varnish is used;
* Adapt ``servers_conf.vcl`` file to match system environment;
* Restart Varnish service;
* Update OXID eShop ``config.inc.php``;
* Update OXID eShop settings in admin area.

The above steps are described with more detail in the topics below:

Download package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because ``oxid-esales/varnish-configuration`` is a ``composer`` package and
``composer`` tool is available for VM by default we could use the following
OXID eShop version independent way to download the package:

.. code::

  # Register private password protected repository
  composer global config repositories.oxid-esales/varnish-configuration \
    composer https://packages.oxid-esales.com/varnish/

  # Download the actual package
  composer global require oxid-esales/varnish-configuration

Keep in mind that ``composer`` will ask for username and password as the package
is available only to users who have bought the **performance package**
(https://www.oxid-esales.com/performance/). Please use the credentials which
were provided during the purchase.

By default a configuration which is compatible with Varnish ``4.0.x`` will be
provided. In order to see which other versions are available as well, please use
the following command:

.. code::

  composer global show --all oxid-esales/varnish-configuration

And to download the package with selected version, e.g. ``3.0.0``:

.. code::

  composer global require oxid-esales/varnish-configuration:v3.0.0

Install package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the package has been downloaded into global ``vendor`` directory as
described by the topic above it becomes possible to transfer configuration
files into the system by using these commands:

.. code::

  sudo cp $HOME/.composer/vendor/oxid-esales/varnish-configuration/default.vcl \
    /etc/varnish/

  sudo cp $HOME/.composer/vendor/oxid-esales/varnish-configuration/servers_conf.vcl.dist \
    /etc/varnish/servers_conf.vcl

Adapt configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two mandatory placeholders which need to be updated inside the
``servers_conf.vcl`` file:

* ``<my_shop_hostname>`` - a valid host which could be used to communicate with
  the shop internaly;
* ``<my_shop_IP>`` - an inbound external IP address which has rights to trigger
  cache invalidation.

The following commands could be used with a default configuration of VM to
replace the placeholder values with suitable ones:

.. code::

  sudo sed -i "s/<my_shop_hostname>/127.0.0.1/g" /etc/varnish/servers_conf.vcl

  sudo sed -i "s/<my_shop_IP>/$(ip addr | grep eth1 | tail -n 1 \
    | grep -oE "(\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b)" | head -n 1)/g" \
    /etc/varnish/servers_conf.vcl

Restart service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After adapting the configuration files it's now possible to restart Varnish
service in order for the updated configuration to take effect:

.. code::

  sudo /etc/init.d/varnish restart

Update OXID eShop configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because Varnish uses ``6081`` port by default this needs to be reflected in
the configuration file ``/var/www/oxideshop/source/config.inc.php``.

If e.g. the hostname was used as ``oxideshop.dev`` the following change must be
applied, from:

.. code::

  $this->sShopURL = 'http://oxideshop.dev';

into:

.. code::

  $this->sShopURL = 'http://oxideshop.dev:6081';

Update admin area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After all of the steps above one must apply necessary changes in the admin
area of the OXID eShop:

* Visit http://oxideshop.dev:6081/admin/
* Choose ``Master settings``
* Select ``Core settings``
* Switch to ``Caching``
* Expand ``Reverse proxy``
* Tick ``Enable caching``

To check if Reverse proxy cache is active, please click
``Test Reverse Proxy's availability``. In case of successful configuration
the following green colored message will appear "Reverse Proxy test succeed".

Trigger Selenium installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trigger `Selenium <http://www.seleniumhq.org/>`_ installation so that it can be
used to run Selenium tests with the help of
`OXID testing library <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/testing_library.git>`_.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  selenium:
    install: true

Together with Selenium, a vnc server is installed in order to connect via remote
display. Suitable clients are e.g. ``vinagre`` on Linux or the built-in vnc
client of OS X.

Trigger IonCube integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trigger `IonCube <http://www.ioncube.com/>`_ integration so that it can be
used to decode the encoded files.

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  ioncube:
    install: true

Customize email monitoring integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integration of `Mailhog <https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog>`_ allows to monitor
e-mail activity from the eShop. List of e-mails could be seen at:
http://www.oxideshop.dev/mail/

Possible configuration options for Mailhog:

* ``web_port`` - web UI port (``8025`` is the default value which means that the
  UI can be accessed by the following URL: http://www.oxideshop.dev:8025/)
* ``smtp_port`` - SMTP server port (``1025`` is the default value)
* ``web_alias`` - an URL alias for the default virtual host to act as a proxy
  for web UI of mailhog (``/mail/`` is the default value which means that the UI
  can be access by the following URL: http://www.oxideshop.dev/mail/)

An example configuration which changes web UI port to ``8024``, SMTP port to
``1026`` and alias to ``/emails/``:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  mailhog:
    web_port: 8024
    smtp_port: 1026
    web_alias: /emails/

Mailhog is installed by default as it has ``install: true`` option in the
default configuration file. In order to disable email monitoring please use the
following configuration snippet:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  mailhog:
    install: false

Customize MySQL administration web app integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integration of `Adminer <https://github.com/vrana/adminer>`_ allows to access
MySQL administrative tasks and data through web alias ``adminer`` at:
http://www.oxideshop.dev/adminer/

Integration of
`Adminer editor <https://github.com/vrana/adminer/tree/master/editor>`_ allows
to access and modify MySQL data through web alias ``adminer_editor`` at:
http://www.oxideshop.dev/adminer_editor/

Possible configuration options for **Adminer** and **Adminer editor**:

* ``pkg_url`` - An URL which points to the compiled PHP version of the
  application
* ``web_alias`` - An alias used to access the application (Default value is
  ``adminer``/``adminer_editor``, which means that in order to access it one has
  to open http://www.oxideshop.dev/adminer/ /
  http://www.oxideshop.dev/adminer_editor/)
* ``pkg_sha256`` - A SHA-256 hash of file contents downloaded from resource
  defined in ``pkg_url``

**Adminer** and **Adminer editor** are installed by default as they have
``install: true`` option in the default configuration file. In order to disable
these tools please use the following configuration snippet:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  adminer:
    install: false
  adminer_editor:
    install: false

Keep in mind that your MySQL credentials will be already present in the login
page and there is **no need to enter the login data manually**. The following
variables are used to gain MySQL credentials:

* ``mysql.user`` - User name which has access to the created database
* ``mysql.password`` - Password of previously mentioned user
* ``mysql.database`` - Name of the newly created database

Composer parallel install plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The composer parallel install plugin
`hirak/prestissimo <https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo>`_ is enabled by default.
In order to disable it please use the following snippet:

.. code:: yaml

  ---
  php:
    composer:
      prestissimo:
        install: false

.. [#personal_git_ignore] ``personal.yml`` configuration file is already
  included in ``.gitignore`` and should not be visible as changes to the actual
  repository.
.. [#assets_repository] Repository with some already prebuilt versions of
  php for faster installation.
.. [#list_of_providers] VM solutions from `VMWare <http://www.vmware.com/>`_,
  such as `workstation <http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation>`_ and
  `fusion <http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion>`_ were not yet adapted or
  tested with our current configuration of VM.
.. [#lxc_provider] Keep in mind that LXC provider is only available for
  GNU/Linux based operating systems. In order to start using this provider with
  vagrant a plugin must be installed for it
  (``vagrant plugin install vagrant-lxc``). So far it has been only tested with
  Ubuntu based OS with lxc package installed (``sudo apt-get install lxc``).
.. [#parallels_provider] A vagrant plugin must be installed
  (``vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels``) in order to use vagrant with
  Parallels.
.. [#turn_on_utf_mode] Keep in mind that the provided snippet will not change
  the UTF-8 mode of the eShop if the configuration file (``config.inc.php``) is
  already present and defined. In this case one has to make the change of
  ``iUtfMode`` value directly in the ``config.inc.php`` file of the eShop.
.. [#eshop_target] Keep in mind that if the shared folder target does not match
  actual application (eShop) target it has to be specified explicitly by
  defining ``eshop_target_path``.
.. [#github_token] By default github has API access limits set for anonymous
  access. In order to overcome these limits one has to create a github token,
  which could be done as described in:
  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/

SDK
===

Out of the box the VM is equipped with the following SDK components:

* `Module skeleton generator <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/module_skeleton_generator>`_ - module
  which helps to create new OXID eShop modules;
* `Module certification tools <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/module_certification_tools>`_ - a
  collection of tools which allows one to see a detailed report from module
  certification process;
* `Testing library <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/testing_library>`_ - a
  library for writing various kind of tests inside eShop and a set of tools for
  running those tests.

There are also other SDK components which could be found at:
http://wiki.oxidforge.org/SDK

Usage
-----

Module skeleton generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default this module is installed under eShop's ``modules`` directory (by
default it will be ``/var/www/oxideshop/source/modules/`` which is defined by
``eshop_path.modules`` key in configuration).

The module needs to be activated manually. Further instructions on how to enable
and use the module could be found at (*installation part can be skipped*):
https://github.com/OXID-eSales/module_skeleton_generator#usage

Module certification tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default the tools are installed under VM's home folder (``~/eshop_sdk`` which
is defined by ``eshop.sdk.path`` key in configuration). The repository of tools
is cloned out in ``~/eshop_sdk/module_certification_tools`` and an extra
shortcut ``ox_cert`` is created inside ``~/eshop_sdk/bin/`` (it's included in
``PATH`` environment variable automatically).

There is no need to do any installation part for tools to work as it is already
done by the VM's provision process.

In order to invoke the certification report generator just use the provided
shortcut:

``ox_cert <vendor_name>/<module_name>``

An example of invoking the reporting tool for module generator
[#cert_tools_call]_:

.. code:: bash

  $ ox_cert oxps/modulegenerator

After the execution it will generate a HTML document which will be placed at
``~/eshop_sdk/module_certification_tools/result/<datetime>/report.html``.

Once the report is generated one can just view the contents of it straight
from inside the VM using command line tools or copy the file to shared folder
and view it from host machine, e.g.:

.. code:: bash

  cp ~/eshop_sdk/module_certification_tools/result/20150916101719/report.html \
    /var/www/oxideshop

Testing library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Library needed for various testing purposes is already installed in the VM
through the help of `composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_, because it's defined
in ``composer.json`` as development requirement inside eShop (at least in CE
latest development version).

All binary tools are installed inside ``/var/www/oxideshop/source/vendor/bin/``
(this value may be changed through ``eshop_path.source`` key in configuration).

A list of available binary tools:

* ``reset-shop`` - restore eShop's database to it's default state (demo);
* ``runmetrics`` - run `pdepend <http://pdepend.org/>`_ against eShop and
  modules code to collect various code metrics information;
* ``runtests`` - run unit/integartion tests against eShop and modules code;
* ``runtests-coverage`` - generate coverage report by running unit/integration
  tests;
* ``runtests-selenium`` - run acceptance tests written for Selenium.

More details on how to use and configure the library could be found at:
https://github.com/OXID-eSales/testing_library

.. [#cert_tools_call] The tools can be invoked from any working directory as
  long as the ``ox_cert`` shortcut is being used.

Guides
======

List of guides for working with VM:

How to update the VM
--------------------

* Open VM directory:

.. code:: bash

  cd oxvm_eshop

* Destroy old VM:

.. code:: bash

  vagrant destroy

* Update eShop VM:

.. code:: bash

  git pull

* Update Base VM:

.. code:: bash

  git submodule update --recursive

* Start VM:

.. code:: bash

  vagrant up

Use eShop packages instead of repositories
------------------------------------------

Our current `eShop packages <http://wiki.oxidforge.org/Downloads/4.9.5_5.2.5>`_
have different file/directory structure compared to
`eShop repositories <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxideshop_ce>`_. VM is
suited to work for eShop repository file/directory structure (*because it
holds our source and test files at the same place*). Due to this reason one
would need to manually extract eShop source and test packages into shared
folder.

In order to prepare VM for usage of eShop packages please follow the steps below
**before** running the VM:

* Create shared folder [#shared_folder]_ (*By default it's* ``oxideshop``
  *folder*);
* Extract source package into ``oxideshop/source`` folder;
* Extract tests package into ``oxideshop/tests`` folder
  (*This step is optional for eShop runtime*).

If the above steps were done **after** the creation/provision of VM please make
sure to re-run ``vagrant provision`` command for provision process to make
necessary changes.

Don't forget that packages usally contain older version of eShop which requires
`additional work <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop#use-older-eshop-version>`_
besides the work which will be done by the provision process.

**Directory structure overview of eShop packages placed for the VM**:

.. code:: bash

  oxvm_eshop - root of oxvm_eshop repository
  + <oxvm_eshop repository files>
  + oxideshop - shared folder
     + source
        + <eShop source package contents>
     + tests
        + <eShop tests package contents>

**An example of commands to prepare VM for using eShop packages**:

Keep in mind that the below example only demonstrates how one should prepare
the VM for source and test packages. In order to actually get/download source
and test packages for eShop PE/EE versions please contact
`OXID eSales support <https://www.oxid-esales.com/en/support-services/software-maintenance-and-support.html>`_.

In case the following two packages were received:

* ``OXID_ESHOP_EE_5.2.5_for_PHP_5.6.zip``  - source package
* ``OXID_ESHOP_TESTS_EE_5.2.5_for_PHP_5.6_SOURCE.rar`` - test package

.. code:: bash

  # Clone out VM repository
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_eshop.git
  cd oxvm_eshop

  # Download packages
  wget http://<url provided by support>/OXID_ESHOP_EE_5.2.5_for_PHP_5.6.zip
  wget http://<url provided by support>/OXID_ESHOP_TESTS_EE_5.2.5_for_PHP_5.6_SOURCE.rar

  # Extract packages
  mkdir oxideshop
  unzip OXID_ESHOP_TESTS_EE_5.2.5_for_PHP_5.6_SOURCE.rar -d ./oxideshop/source/
  unrar x OXID_ESHOP_TESTS_EE_5.2.5_for_PHP_5.6_SOURCE.rar ./oxideshop/tests/

  # Start the VM
  vagrant up

.. [#shared_folder] The actual sharing process of the folder will be done by
  the VM provision process, end-user only needs to create this folder and make
  sure the folder exists. The path and name of the folder is configurable via
  the ``vagrant_local.vm.app_shared_folder`` parameter. By default it's
  ``<oxvm_eshop_root>/oxideshop``. More information about how to configure this
  value can be found in:
  `Change shared folder path <#change-shared-folder-path>`_ .

How to provision individual parts
---------------------------------

In order to provision only individual part of the VM one can simply use
``ANSIBLE_TAGS`` environment variable. Consider the following examples:

.. code:: bash

  # Provision PHP and MySQL parts only
  ANSIBLE_TAGS=php,mysql vagrant provision

  # Provision OXID eShop related part only
  ANSIBLE_TAGS=eshop vagrant provision

Ansible tags are marked inside ``roles`` directories. To get a list of them try running the following command:

.. code:: bash

  grep -r -A 2 --include="*.yml" "tags\:" .


Troubleshooting
===============

List of troubleshooting items:

Provision process hangs on "Run composer install" task
------------------------------------------------------

During the provision process (*which could be invoked implicitly by*
``vagrant up`` *or explicitly by* ``vagrant provision``) a task ``Run composer
install`` might hang (*waiting for time-out*) because github access API limit
has been reached and ``composer`` is asking for github account username/password
which could resolve the API limit. ``Ansible`` will not provide this information
to ``STDOUT`` or ``STDERR`` so it will look like the task just hanged.

Since there are no options to provide username/password for this particular task
one could just use a github API token which will allow to overcome the API
access limit.

How to create and configure a github token is described in
`Define github token for composer <#define-github-token-for-composer>`_ chapter.

Error from `Unit_Admin_ModuleListTest::testRender()` method while testing eShop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Older versions of eShop contains a very strict test inside
`Unit_Admin_ModuleListTest::testRender()` method which tries to match the exact
list of available modules. The test method might fail because VM includes SDK
components and some of them are actual modules (*which will result in modified
list of available modules*).

This is a known issue which is fixed in the development and new upcoming
releases of eShop.

To check which shop is compatible with testing library please refer to `compatibility list <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/testing_library/tree/b-1.0#compatibility-with-oxid-shops>`_.

Browser shows "Zend Guard Run-time support missing!"
----------------------------------------------------

This message will only appear if a
`Zend Guard <https://www.zend.com/en/products/zend-guard>`_ encoded eShop
package is being used. In order to solve the issue one has to install
`Zend Guard Loader <http://www.zend.com/en/products/loader/downloads>`_ which
will decode the encoded PHP files on execution.

To install and enable Zend Guard Loader PHP extension add the following configuration:

.. code:: yaml

  php:
    zendguard:
      install: true

Keep in mind that this extension will only work with the default PHP version, i.e.
at the moment the use of extenion with phpbrew is not automated.

To install and enable Zend Guard Loader PHP extension manually inside the VM:

.. code:: bash

  # From host (local machine)
  vagrant ssh

  # From guest (virtual machine)
  cd /usr/lib/php/20131226/
  sudo wget https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_assets/blob/master/zend-loader-php5.6-linux-x86_64.tar.gz?raw=true -O zend.tar.gz
  sudo tar zxvf zend.tar.gz
  sudo cp zend-loader-php5.6-linux-x86_64/ZendGuardLoader.so ./
  sudo cp zend-loader-php5.6-linux-x86_64/opcache.so ./zend_opcache.so
  cd /etc/php/5.6/mods-available/
  sudo sh -c 'echo "zend_extension=ZendGuardLoader.so" > zend.ini'
  sudo sh -c 'echo "zend_extension=zend_opcache.so" >> zend.ini'
  sudo phpdismod opcache
  sudo phpenmod zend
  sudo service apache2 restart

Keep in mind that different PHP version needs different version of Zend Guard
Loader extension. List of possible extension versions can be found in
`oxvm_assets <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxvm_assets>`_ repository.

More information on how to install and configure Zend Guard Loader can be found
at: http://files.zend.com/help/Zend-Guard/content/installing_zend_guard_loader.htm

On Windows machines, getting "requires a TTY"
---------------------------------------------

The example of error message:

.. code:: bash

  { oxvm_eshop } master » vagrant destroy
  Vagrant is attempting to interface with the UI in a way that requires
  a TTY. Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
  switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
  with TTY.

Please check answers on stackoverflow for your specific case: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23633276/vagrant-is-attempting-to-interface-with-the-ui-in-a-way-that-requires-a-tty

Selenium tests do not run after VM was destroyed: error "Session not started"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Restart selenium server is needed and can be done with command:

.. code:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/selenium restart

Composer returns "ProcessTimedOutException"
-------------------------------------------

In case there are Internet connection issues composer might take longer time to download
various packages and hit ``ProcessTimeOutException``. In order to avoid that configuration can
be updated to increase this time-out:

.. code:: yaml

    php:
      composer:
        timeout: 3000

On Windows machines, fails to install vagrant-hostmanager plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------

Using user name with space in it leads to an error message: 

::

  The directory where plugins are installed (the Vagrant home directory)
  has a space in it. On Windows, there is a bug in Ruby when compiling
  plugins into directories with spaces. Please move your Vagrant home
  directory to a path without spaces and try again.

Possible solution: 

- Install Vagrant in a directory which has no spaces in the path.
- Define Windows Environment Variable ``%VAGRANT_HOME%`` to hold path to the directory ``Path_to_Vagrant\bin``
